#### **12.9 miles (133.1 total)**

I almost quit today. I did not feel very well this morning and decided it would be better for me to just sleep. So I ended up not waking up until 12:30 and after a quick breakfast/lunch hit the trail at about 1:15. I had decided a few miles in that I wanted my girlfriend to come pick me up at Brandon Gap, because I felt very sick and just didn't want to hike anymore. I wasn't able to contact her, so I hiked on.

Luckily the terrain was super easy today and the weather was great so my mood improved. The view from Horrid Cliffs was also a definite mood booster. I made it the 12.9 miles to Sucker Brook shelter by 7:15 and got to meet some pretty cool people there. I think I'm glad that I didn't leave today, although I still don't feel great so I'm looking forward to a day off, hopefully soon.
