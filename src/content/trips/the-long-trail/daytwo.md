#### **14.7 miles (28.0 total)**

Double trail magic day! I left Congdon shelter at around 7 AM and I hiked most of the way to Rt. 9 with Alex and Taylor (whom I had met the night before). There was an awesome gentleman with trail magic in the Rt. 9 parking lot, which was awesome. Then, just a couple hundred feet after that trail head, there was more trail magic!

When we got to Hell Hollow Brook, we caught up to Chaser and met a girl named Sixteen who was actually swimming in the water. A bunch of us gathered and ate lunch there, before I left with Chaser to head towards Glastenbury.

I got to Goddard shelter at around 4:30, and waited for Rob, Alex, and Taylor for about an hour before heading to the Glastenbury fire tower, where we're going to stay the night. The view from the top of the tower is absolutely fantastic! 14.7 miles today.
