**16.6 miles (149.7 total)**

It’s 10 PM and I just spent an hour fixing my hammock setup in the dark without a headlamp (it broke). I’m not sure why I was having trouble tonight, but it put me in kind of a bad mood. Lots of good views today. The terrain is getting a little more difficult. I had a bad fall off of a slippery rock. 16.6 miles today.
