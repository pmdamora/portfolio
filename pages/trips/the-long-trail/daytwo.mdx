**14.7 miles (28.0 total)**

Double trail magic day! I left Congdon shelter at around 7 AM and I hiked most of the way to Rt. 9 with Alex and Taylor (whom I had met the night before). There was an awesome gentleman with trail magic in the Rt. 9 parking lot, which was awesome. Then, just a couple hundred feet after that trail head, there was more trail magic!

When we got to Hell Hollow Brook, we caught up to Chaser and met a girl named Sixteen who was actually swimming in the water. A bunch of us gathered and ate lunch there, before I left with Chaser to head towards Glastenbury.

I got to Goddard shelter at around 4:30, and waited for Rob, Alex, and Taylor for about an hour before heading to the Glastenbury fire tower, where weâ€™re going to stay the night. The view from the top of the tower is absolutely fantastic! 14.7 miles today.
