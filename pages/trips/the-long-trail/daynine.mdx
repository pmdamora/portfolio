**18.6 miles (120.2 total)**

Today was long. I got up and hit the trail by 7:15, and made it to the trailhead by 10:15. A very nice man picked me up and brought me in to town. HE told me all about his life; his health problems, his girlfriend, his kids. He told me he lives vicariously through people like me. It was surprising to see someone open up to me like that. I did my resupply and walked over to a small restaurant to get a late breakfast. Getting a hitch back to the trail was easy, and I got started by 1:15.

When I got to the Rolston Rest shelter, I found Fresh Produce (aka Guardian and Phoenix). I also caught up with Claire and Roo. I chatted for a while before heading on to the David Logan shelter. It started pouring about a mile in, which was actually kind of fun for an hour or so. Eventually my mood kind of turned and I felt like crap when I finally got to the shelter. I didnâ€™t even have the energy to cook dinner. 18.6 miles on a town day is not too bad though.
