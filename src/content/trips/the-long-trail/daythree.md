#### **19.1 miles (47.1 total)**

We got a decent start on our descent of Glastenbury mountain this morning. We made good time and got to Story Spring shelter by about noon, where we stopped for lunch. We caught up to Goose and Ribbet there and also met a guy named Bigfoot who's trying to hike the entire AT in less than 100 days. Just before we got to the base of Stratton Mountain, Taylor started to feel nauseous, so New Addition (Rob) and myself went on.

The climb up Stratton Mountain wasn't too bad, and the view was fantastic. Taylor and Alex were able to catch up to us just before we started the descent to Stratton Pond. There wasn't a caretaker at the shelter that night so we ended up saving a few bucks. I was pretty tired, so I tried to stay in the shelter for a couple of hours, but I was having trouble sleeping, so I went into the woods and set up my hammock and slept like a baby after that. 19.1 miles for the day.
