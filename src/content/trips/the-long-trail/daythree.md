#### **13.3 miles (13.3 total)**

I started off at around 9 AM at the Pine Cobble trail head. I made pretty good time up the trail -- the view from Pine Cobble was fantastic -- and I was at the Long Trail trail head by 11 AM. I ended up forgetting to bring toilet paper, so all I had was a couple of tissues I got from my dad's car. We're about to get a little graphic here, but I would have probably been okay, though unfortunately I was super sick to my stomach all day, and ended using all of the tissues as toilet paper today. I guess I'll get to try using natural toilet paper until I get to Manchester Center.

I met some really cool people today, and was lucky enough to experience my first trail magic. The trail angel was super cool; he just finished the AT (in four months!) and is starting the PCT SOBO next week. I got to Congdon shelter a bit before 6 and I'm gonna hang here for the night. Only 13.3 miles for the day, but I guess I'm in no rush.
