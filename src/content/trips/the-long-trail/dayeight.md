#### **4.3 miles (101.6 total)**

Another late start today (maybe I should set an alarm). I didn't leave camp until 10 AM, and then I slowly trudged up Killington Peak. It was super hot, and I was probably still a bit dehydrated from yesterday, so I didn't get to the summit until 1 PM. It was an amazing view, despite all of the development. I had planned to spend the night in Rutland, but instead I decided to hang out in Killington all day.

I went to the Peak Lodge and spent roughly 4 hours hanging out, eating food, and charging my phone/battery. I even gave myself a mini-shower in the bathroom and did some laundry in the sink. It was a super relaxing day and it felt good to not have to be anywhere. I think sometimes when I hike I get focused on getting to a certain destination everyday. It would be nice to just hike all day until I don't feel like hiking anymore. If I stealth camped, I guess that would be more my style, but unfortunately I don't think the Long Trail really inspires that sort of hiking, since stealth camping is discouraged. It was a great Nero day though. 4.3 miles.
