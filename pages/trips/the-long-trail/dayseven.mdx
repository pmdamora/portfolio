**19.8 miles (97.3 total)**

I didn’t feel nearly as good today as I did the day before. It was easy hiking, but I felt sluggish all day. I now realize it’s probably because I was adding Mio to my water all day, rather than drinking normal water. Oh well, rookie mistake. I got a nice surprise when I got to Clarendon Gorge. Alex and Taylor were waiting just before the bridge with trail magic! I got Kool Aid, Frito’s, and Capri Sun. Seriously some A+ trail magic, plus it was cool to catch up. Turns out they won’t be getting back on the trail again for a week.

I still felt super sluggish after I passed Clarendon shelter and ended up taking a nap on top of Beacon Hill. It was at this point I realized I need some actual water (my water was almost brown), so I basically ran to the next stream. Looks like there is usually permanent trail magic at that stream, but I guess all of it was gone by the time I got there. That was probably a good thing anyway; the last thing I needed was more crappy drinks. I filled up on water and still felt pretty bad, and it was started to get late. I decided to make dinner, and if I felt okay after that, I would keep going.

After about an hour, I decided to do the last 3.6 miles to Governor Clement shelter. I went as fast as I could the whole way and rolled in just after 9. I did that final stretch in about 1 hour and 15 minutes. I wish I could have done the whole day that fast. I have my hammock in a cool spot where I can hear the water, and I’m ready to a good night’s sleep. Pretty pumped to summit Killington tomorrow! 19.8 miles today, can’t wait until I finally break 20!
