#### **10.6 miles (57.7 total)**

Today wasn't too bad for hiking. We only had to do an easy 10.6 miles to get to the VT 11/30 trailhead. The whole way was VT flat, so it went quickly and I got to the trailhead at 1:15. Finding a hitch into town wasn't too difficult (it only took about 5 minutes) and we ended up grabbing some food at a small bar called Firefly.

At about about 5 PM we left the bar and went on to do our resupply. I got way too much food, but it all looks tasty, and I'm looking forward to eating it (not carrying it though). The shower at the Green Mountain House was amazing. We ordered pizza for dinner and got ready to hit the trail again tomorrow.
