**18.7 miles (200.9 total)**

My hard day yesterday didn’t leave me with a lot of energy for today. I didn’t leave camp until 10 and then I had an easy walk down to the road. I didn’t really enjoy the whole Winooski River section. It was tons of road walking and walking around farm land, which was pretty boring. Luckily I was able to move quickly which helped make up for my late start.

The hike up Bolton Mountain was pretty boring and uneventful, and the hike to Taylor Lodge was more of the same. I’ve been to Taylor Lodge before, so it was good to be in a familiar place, plus the view is fantastic. I can hear what I believe is a fisher cat maybe 50 feet from my hammock, which is kind of freaky, so hopefully it leaves soon. All in all, it was a good but boring day, which is probably what I needed after yesterday. 18.7 miles.
