#### **17.8 miles (77.5 total)**

Today was a great day. I woke up at about 5:30 AM, heard rain, and decided to sleep a bit more. Well I didn't end up leaving camp until 10:30, but by the time I got up, there was no more rain, and I felt great. The hike to the summit of Bromley didn't take long, and there were some amazing views. I didn't see any spots for a hammock, so it was probably good that I didn't camp there the night before. I was a little bummed that the peak was so developed; it takes away from the wilderness vibes, but it did provide for a very open summit, which was nice. I hiked to Styles Peak for lunch, which also had a good view.

After I left Styles I felt really pumped and started going pretty fast. Baker Peak had looked kind of boring based on the Guthooks guide, but it was a beautiful view for very little work. At the USFS 10 trailhead, I was lucky enough to get an ice cream sandwich and a soda from some trail angels. On the final 2 miles to Little Rock Pond, I slipped and fell down pretty hard. One of my poles got slightly bent and I got a little bruised, but nothing too bad.

I got to swim and rinse some clothes in the pond when I finally made it to the shelter at about 6:20 PM. 17.8 miles today, and I hiked all of it alone,  which was kind of nice after doing so much group hiking in the first section. Less than 200 miles to go!
