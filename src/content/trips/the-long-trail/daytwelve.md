#### **5.1 miles (154.8 total)**

Today I only hiked the 5.1 miles to the Lincoln Gap. The trail wasn't too hard, and there were lots of great views for such a short distance. I actually ended up running the last couple of miles (except for the rocky ledges) since it was mostly a gradual downhill dirt trail. I will be spending the night in Burlington with my girlfriend, and hopefully I will return to the trail tomorrow.
