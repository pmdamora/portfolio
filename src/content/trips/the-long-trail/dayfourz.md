Unfortunately today I'm going to have to leave the trail for a couple of days. Alex and Taylor will also be leaving in order to sort out their resupplies and gear, while New Edition will be switching to section hiking. I'm already itching to get back out on the trail, but there are more important things than trail life at the moment.

Jeff dropped us off in town at a cute little restaurant this morning called Up For Breakfast, where we got breakfast. I got a maple latte and eggs Benedict. After we finished eating, we walked over to Price Chopper and waited for Alex and Taylor's ride, who was kind enough to give me a life to Burlington as well. I'm exited to see my girlfriend for a couple of days, and I can't wait to get back on Sunday.
