**2.0 miles (59.7 total)**

Amanda dropped me off at the Rt 11⁄30 trailhead at about 6:30 PM today. I made great time to the Bromley shelter and got there just after 7. I started to continue on to the summit, but I realized I had forgotten to camel up on water, so I ended up staying at the Bromley shelter. Only 2 miles today, but I’m excited to get back to it tomorrow!
